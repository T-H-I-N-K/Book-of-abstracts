There is no doubt about it: A variety of methods that are easy to access can make \textbf{R} a valuable tool for plenty application scenarios in business e.g. optimize sales campaigns by scoring potential customers, predicting machines failures with patterns from sensor data or make weather forecasts to get guidance for trading and supplying energy. The knowledge in those kind of scenarios has emerged from the young discipline of data science and is tied with contemporary methods from data mining and predictive analytics.

At the same time there are plenty of further application scenarios for \textbf{R} which are not straight connected to data science but are substantially impacted by the classical analytics that is used in business or in particular in industry. For example in process controls, process validation or cyclic reports. Even though \textbf{R} reaches an incredible popularity for data science methods, companies struggle to make \textbf{R} accessible for their classical analytics.

The talk will delight the differences of data science and classical analytics and reveal the underrated potential for \textbf{R} in business processes that are dominated by particular software. Furthermore the talk will give an outlook for \textbf{R} in the field of analytics.
