Dear participant,

Welcome to the European R users meeting \textit{eRum 2016} which will be held at Poznan University of Economics and Business, Poland, 12-14 October 2016.

In addition, a series of short training courses will take place during the first day of the Conference (12 October 2016).

Conferences succeed through the contributions of their participants. So we are happy to offer you an interesting and broad program. Owing to the overwhelming response to our call for papers, most sessions will run in parallel. The Conference aims to cover relevant and innovative topics including: Bayesian Statistics, Bioinformatics, Economics, Finance and Insurance, Industrial Applications, Spatial Statistics, and many more.

Besides the scientific program, the eRum Conference will be held in a familial atmosphere. There will be a poster session on Thursday evening with a Welcome paRty. The Saturday sightseeing tour will take us to the most famous places in Poznan. Your stay in Poznan will be an opportunity to enjoy other cultural activities in Poznan.
